  <!-- Summary / Keypoints -->
  <div class="keypoints">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rubies (corundum, Mohs 9) symbolize passion and protection. They span vivid reds from pigeon-blood to pinkish red, perform beautifully in solitaire, halo, and vintage settings, and pair well with diamond accents. Prices vary widely by color saturation and clarity; gentle care keeps the color glowing for generations.
  </div>

  <p class="lede">
    Considering a <strong>ruby engagement ring</strong>? This guide explains what makes ruby irresistible — from royal heritage and vivid color to durability, pricing, vintage styles, and care. You’ll also see real client stories and how to design a ring that carries your meaning.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Choose Ruby?</h2>
  <p>
    Ruby has long symbolized <em>love, courage, and protection</em>. Its fiery hue stands out against gold or platinum and reads well in both minimalist and ornate designs. As a member of the corundum family (like sapphire), ruby ranks <strong>9 on the Mohs scale</strong>, making it a strong choice for daily wear.

  <h2>Color, Clarity & Cut</h2>

  <p>
    Color rules ruby value. The most prized tones are saturated, slightly purplish to pure red (often called “pigeon blood”). Inclusions are common and expected; eye-clean rubies are rare. Cuts that maximize color — oval, cushion, and antique-inspired shapes — are popular for engagement rings.
  </p>

  <h2>Pros &amp; Cons of Ruby Engagement Rings</h2>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Iconic color:</strong> Red communicates passion and commitment at a glance.</li>
    <li><strong>Durable:</strong> Mohs 9 hardness makes ruby suitable for everyday wear.</li>
    <li><strong>Versatile styles:</strong> Looks stunning in classic solitaires, diamond halos, and vintage settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Price sensitivity to color:</strong> Fine, saturated reds can be expensive.</li>
    <li><strong>Treatments:</strong> Heat treatment is common; ask your jeweler for disclosure and documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Popular Styles & Settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Solitaire Minimal:</strong> Oval/cushion ruby on a slim band — timeless and modern.</li>
    <li><strong>Ruby & Diamond Halo:</strong> White diamonds frame the red center, increasing brilliance and presence.</li>
    <li><strong>Vintage / Antique-Inspired:</strong> Milgrain, filigree, and baguette sides for heirloom character.</li>
    <li><strong>East–West or Bezel:</strong> Contemporary silhouettes with added protection for daily wear.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Price & Value</h2>
  <p>
    Pricing depends on color saturation, carat, clarity, origin, and whether the stone is natural or lab-created.
    Many custom rings fall in <strong>$1,200–$4,000</strong>, while top-color natural rubies command higher budgets.

  <h2>Care & Maintenance</h2>
  <p>
    Clean with warm water, mild soap, and a soft brush; dry with a lint-free cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals and extreme heat. Professional inspections keep prongs secure and the stone safe for daily wear. See

  </p>

  <h2>Ruby vs Diamond</h2>
  <p>
    Diamonds win on brilliance; rubies win on color emotion and individuality. Many couples choose a hybrid:
    a ruby center with diamond halo/shoulders, blending symbolic red with classic sparkle.
  </p>

  <h2>Real Stories</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/stories/ruby-story-a.jpg" alt="Oval ruby solitaire in 18K yellow gold made for Ana" />
    <figcaption>Ana’s oval ruby solitaire in 18K yellow gold — simple, warm, and deeply personal.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Ana, Lisbon.</strong> She brought a phone snapshot of a small ring her grandmother wore every Sunday. The request was modest: “Nothing flashy — just the same feeling.”  
    We selected a vivid oval ruby and set it on a rounded 18K yellow-gold band, slightly tapered for comfort.  
    When Ana tried it on, she smiled and said, “It feels like home.” There were no grand gestures — only a quiet, steady joy.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/images/stories/ruby-story-b.jpg" alt="Ruby and diamond halo engagement ring custom for Noah and Mei" />
    <figcaption>Noah &amp; Mei’s ruby-and-diamond halo — a bridge between traditions.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Noah &amp; Mei, Vancouver.</strong> They wanted a ring that honored two families. His mother loved diamonds; her family celebrated red for luck.  
    We designed a cushion ruby with a white-diamond halo in 18K white gold. The first thing Mei said was, “It looks like both of us.”  
    A ring can be a compromise — or a meeting point. Theirs became the latter.
