    <h2>💎 What is Moss Agate?</h2>
    <p>
      Despite its name, moss agate is technically not a true agate, as it lacks the concentric banding. Instead, it is a form of chalcedony—a translucent quartz—filled with dendritic inclusions of manganese or iron that resemble moss, ferns, or forest scenes. This makes every stone completely unique, like a tiny world captured in crystal.

    <h2>🔄 Why Choose Moss Agate Over Diamonds?</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing a <strong>non-diamond engagement ring</strong> is more than a budget decision—it’s often an emotional and philosophical one. Diamonds have long symbolized luxury and permanence, but moss agate offers something more organic, personal, and expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who feel disconnected from the traditional norms of love and marriage, moss agate brings back intention and individuality. It's a gemstone that speaks softly but deeply, a reflection of inner peace and growth rather than outward perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, moss agate is also more affordable than diamonds, making it accessible without compromising on sentiment. It's a powerful way to say: “This love is grounded. This love grows.”
    </p>

    <h2>🧡 Real Story: “It Felt Like the Forest Was With Me”</h2>
    <p>
      When Clara came to us, she wasn’t looking for a diamond. “I grew up in the Pacific Northwest,” she told us, “and moss agate reminded me of home—the ferns, the stillness after rain.” We designed her ring with a marquise-cut moss agate and a vine-like gold band. “Now, every time I look at it, I feel grounded. Like the forest is with me.”

    <h2>⚒️ Moss Agate Durability & How to Care for It</h2>
    <p>
      Moss agate ranks around 6.5 to 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, which means it's durable enough for everyday wear with some care. Unlike diamonds or sapphires, it’s a softer stone that can scratch if worn carelessly or exposed to rough surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend choosing protective settings—like bezels or low-profile prongs—especially if the ring is meant for daily use. When not worn, store it in a soft cloth pouch or padded box, away from harder gemstones. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners and stick to gentle soap and water with a soft brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      With mindful handling, your moss agate jewelry will remain beautiful and full of meaning for many years to come.
