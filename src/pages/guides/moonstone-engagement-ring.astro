<h2 id="is-moonstone-good">Is moonstone good for engagement rings?</h2>
<p>
  Yes‚Äîif you understand its nature and choose a protective design. Moonstone is ~<strong>Mohs 6‚Äì6.5</strong>, which means it
  is softer than diamond/sapphire and can abrade or chip with hard knocks. For most clients who want a poetic, iridescent look,
  it works beautifully when set low and protected, then worn with a bit of care.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good fits:</strong> thoughtful daily wearers, office/creative work, occasional dress wear.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher-risk:</strong> heavy manual work, gym/impact sports‚Äîtake it off.</li>
  <li><strong>Design choices that help:</strong> bezels or low halos, thicker prongs, smooth gallery, no sharp edges.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="best-settings">Best settings for moonstone</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bezel (recommended):</strong> A thin metal rim protects the entire edge while keeping the glow visible.</li>
  <li><strong>Low-profile halo:</strong> Micro-pav√© creates a ‚Äúbuffer ring‚Äù that adds presence and reduces edge exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>Four/six-prong with guards:</strong> Use thicker claws and a lower seat; consider corner guards and a smooth gallery.</li>
  <li><strong>Band choices:</strong> A slightly wider, rounded shank handles daily bumps better; avoid sharp textures that can scratch the stone.</li>
</ul>
