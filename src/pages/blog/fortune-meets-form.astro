    <h1>Fortune Meets Form — The Tarot-Inspired Custom Charm</h1>
    <p>A reversible tarot card charm capturing symbolism, color, and personal meaning.</p>

    <h3>🌟 The Idea: A Card That Speaks</h3>
    <p>This charm was designed for a client who believes jewelry should be more than beautiful—it should speak.</p>

    <p>They envisioned a pendant inspired by tarot cards, capturing both mystery and guidance in a format small enough to wear close to the heart.</p>

    <h3>🪞 Dual Faces, Dual Meanings</h3>
    <p>This double-sided charm features two symbolic designs:</p>

    <h4>🌞 Front – “FORTUNE”</h4>
    <p>A radiant wheel of symbols sits at the center, surrounding a pale violet gemstone like a fortune crystal.</p>

    <h4>🌙 Back – “DEEP-FALL”</h4>
    <p>An engraved crystal cluster rising from the earth beneath a crescent moon and stars.</p>

    <h4>💡 Why It Resonates</h4>
    <p>Whether you wear it for protection, for identity, or just for its hypnotic design—the charm is a reminder:</p>
    <blockquote>"You are the question. And the answer."</blockquote>
