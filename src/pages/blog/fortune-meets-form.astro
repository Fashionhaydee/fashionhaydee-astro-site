    <p>In a world where jewelry is more than just an accessory, the rise of symbolic pieces—those that reflect our identity, beliefs, and inner journeys—has captured the hearts of many. That’s why we created FORTUNE x DEEP-FALL, a reversible custom tarot pendant handcrafted in 925 sterling silver. Whether you seek spiritual alignment or simply want to carry a personal message close to your heart, this dual-sided charm is designed for you.</p>

    <h2>✨ Two Sides, Two Stories—One Powerful Message</h2>
    <p>This tarot cards pendant necklace is more than a piece of jewelry. It’s a totem. A talisman. A conversation between your present self and your future path.</p>

    <p>On one side lies DEEP-FALL, a minimal engraved composition featuring a crystal cluster beneath a crescent moon and stars. Rendered in high-polish silver with subtle oxidized detailing, this side evokes grounding, introspection, and spiritual stillness. Inspired by the Moon and Hermit tarot archetypes, DEEP-FALL is perfect for those who value silence, clarity, and truth beneath the surface.</p>

    <h3>🌟 FORTUNE — The Cosmic Dance</h3>
    <p>Flip the pendant, and enter a world of color and motion. A radiant yellow wheel of fortune spins at the center, surrounded by orbiting multi-color crystals and celestial motifs. At the heart sits a violet gemstone—symbol of wisdom, mysticism, and change. This side reflects momentum, protection, and the belief that the universe is always turning in your favor.</p>
