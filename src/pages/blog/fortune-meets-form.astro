    <p>In a world where jewelry is more than just an accessory, the rise of symbolic pieces—those that reflect our identity, beliefs, and inner journeys—has captured the hearts of many.

    <p>On one side lies DEEP-FALL, a minimal engraved composition featuring a crystal cluster beneath a crescent moon and stars. Rendered in high-polish silver with subtle oxidized detailing, this side evokes grounding, introspection, and spiritual stillness. Inspired by the Moon and Hermit tarot archetypes, DEEP-FALL is perfect for those who value silence, clarity, and truth beneath the surface.</p>

    <h3>🌟 FORTUNE — The Cosmic Dance</h3>
    <p>Flip the pendant, and enter a world of color and motion. A radiant yellow wheel of fortune spins at the center, surrounded by orbiting multi-color crystals and celestial motifs. At the heart sits a violet gemstone—symbol of wisdom, mysticism, and change. This side reflects momentum, protection, and the belief that the universe is always turning in your favor.</p>
