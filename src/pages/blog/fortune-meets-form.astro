    <h2>🌓 Dual Faces, Dual Meanings</h2>
    <p>This double-sided charm features two symbolic designs:</p>

    <h3>🌟 Front – “FORTUNE”</h3>
    <p>A radiant wheel of symbols sits at the center, surrounding a pale violet gemstone like a fortune crystal.</p>

    <h3>🌙 Back – “DEEP-FALL”</h3>
    <p>An engraved crystal cluster rising from the earth beneath a crescent moon and stars.</p>

    <h2>💡 Why It Resonates</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you wear it for protection, for identity, or just for its hypnotic design—the charm is a reminder:
      <br />
      <em>"You are the question. And the answer."</em>
