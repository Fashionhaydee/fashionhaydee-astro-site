    <p>“I live in an area with many forests,” Robyn told us, “so I want something to mimic our many ferns.” From the moment she shared this thought, we knew her piece wouldn’t be like any other.</p>

    <p>While most moss agate rings on the market use hollowed-out under-galleries, Robyn envisioned a leafy foundation that would reflect her love for nature. We translated her concept into CAD (see below).</p>

    <p>The result? A poetic balance between structure and softness. The gemstone rests on a sculpted bed of leaves—like forest light filtering through branches.</p>
