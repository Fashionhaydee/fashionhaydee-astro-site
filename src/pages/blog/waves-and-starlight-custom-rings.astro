    <h2>Waves, Stars, and Everyday Life</h2>
    <p>
      It started with a simple voice note:  
      <em>"I want a pair of rings I can wear every day, nothing too much, but with a story. Something about the sea, the sky, and a little starlight.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Those few words instantly set my mind adrift. I began doodling gentle wave curves on paper, letting the lines run free like a tide—sometimes swirling, sometimes just quietly flowing. We talked about how life can feel both vast and light, like clouds drifting above the ocean. So, I added tiny diamonds, each catching the light like a star you’d spot on a night walk by the sea.

      But it wasn’t finished. The client messaged me: <em>“Can we add a fishtail somewhere? Just a hint, not obvious.”</em><br>
      I loved that idea. A tiny fishtail, barely noticeable, now tucked into the band—just for her. The ring became something between freedom and daily comfort, a piece that never shouts but always moves.

    <p>
      This set was 18K gold with blue sapphire details—minimal, lively, just like the sea after the rain. We finished everything for about $2,600, but the real value, I think, is that sense of “this ring is just for me.”
