    <h2>Mountains, Letters, and Nightfall</h2>
    <p>
      Some custom ideas feel like poetry before you even start drawing.<br>
      This couple sent me a late-night note:  
      <em>"We want something for both of us. My surname starts with D, his with M. But also, we love mountains, rivers, the kind of peace you get looking at the night sky.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought, why not let their initials become the landscape?  
      For her, I drew a soft “D” that slipped into a river’s curve, the tail rising up into a new-moon crescent. It was delicate and quiet, but carried her story.

      For him, the “M” felt stronger—broad at the base, peaking like a ridge, stars scattered along the side. I wanted the two rings to look like they were telling the same story, even if you only wore one at a time.

      I remember showing them the wax models and watching her smile when she recognized her initial hidden in the design. It’s that moment I love most—when the client suddenly sees themselves in the piece.

      This pair cost about the same—just under $2,600. But what lasts is the scene: two rings, two initials, and a shared world where every line means something.
