✨ The Idea: A Card That Speaks  
This charm was designed for a client who believes jewelry should be more than beautiful—it should speak.

They envisioned a pendant inspired by tarot cards, capturing both mystery and guidance in a format small enough to wear close to the heart.

🌓 Dual Faces, Dual Meanings  
This double-sided charm features two symbolic designs:

🌟 Front – “FORTUNE”  
A radiant wheel of symbols sits at the center, surrounding a pale violet gemstone like a fortune crystal.

🌙 Back – “DEEP-FALL”  
An engraved crystal cluster rising from the earth beneath a crescent moon and stars.

💡 Why It Resonates  
Whether you wear it for protection, for identity, or just for its hypnotic design—the charm is a reminder:  
"You are the question. And the answer."
